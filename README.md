## My process

-> There is a main SASS file ( main.scss ) that importes all olher SASS files with the objective to get a more organized and scalable project with the intencion to get the best pratices at this early stage of my learning.

-> Finnaly i transform all SASS content into a styles.css file and call it in the index.html
